CMUQ 15-110: Principles of Computing<br>
Class Notes: Food Web
</h1>
<hr>
A foodweb is described in a file using pairs 'prey,predator' on each line.

During the lecture on March, 11th, the class has developed a program that reads
this foodweb and stores it in a dictionary. The program contains additional
functions to get the predators and preys of an animal, and to find the tertiary
consumers and producers of the web.

This was tested with two input files: the <a href="lettuce-foodweb.csv">foodweb</a> 
suggested by the students in class and 
the <a href="Florida-foodweb.csv">foodweb</a> from Florida bay (obtained <a
href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/Florida-bay.html">here</a>).
