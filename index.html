      <h4>Getting the Assignments</h4>
      
      <p>
        The writeup and starter files for each assignment can be found on 
        <a href="https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/15110q-s19"><u>Autolab</u></a>.
        Log in with your andrewID, select the course and then the assignment.
        You can see the <code>pdf</code> with the instructions by clicking on
        "View writeup".
        The starter code and template for typing your answers are in a
        <code>zip</code> file which can be downloaded by clicking on "Download
        handout".
        Uncompressing this file will create the directory
        <code>&lt;asgn&gt;-handout</code> with the starter code.
        <span class="text-danger"><b>If you need to download these files again, be
        careful not to overwrite your work!</b></span>
      </p>
      
      <h4>Submitting the Assignments</h4>

      <p>
        You need to submit a <code>zip</code> file containing the completed
        started code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>zip</code> file needs to be submitted to
        <a href="https://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu/courses/15110q-s19"><u>Autolab</u></a>.
        It will immediately run a series of tests on your code and give you a
        score with some feedback. Make sure to check it! If your code does not
        pass all tests, you can submit it again until the deadline. <span
        class="text-danger"><b>You are limited to a total of 10 submissions
        for each assignment.</b></span>

      <p class="text-danger"><b>Collaboration is regulated by the whiteboard policy: you can bounce
      ideas about a homework with other students, but when it comes to typing
      it down for submission, you are on your own. You are not allowed to use
      notes, files, pictures, etc, from any previous discussion nor previous
      versions of this course.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      We will run a program that detects code similarity on all your homework
      submissions. If students are found to have submitted almost the same
      code, they will be contacted and this may result on an academic integrity
      violation report.

      <h4>An Invitation to Students with Learning Disabilities:</h4>
      <p>
      Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable
      accommodations for all persons with disabilities. To access
      accommodation services you are expected to initiate the request and
      submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to the office of Health
      &amp; Wellness or CaPS-Q. In order to receive services/accommodations,
      verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a
      doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. The
      office of Health &amp; Wellness, CaPS-Q and Office of Disability Resources
      in Pittsburgh will review the information you provide. All information
      will be considered confidential and only released to appropriate persons
      on a need to know basis.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Once the accommodations have been approved, you will be issued a Summary
      of Accommodations Memorandum documenting the disability and describing
      the accommodation. You are responsible for providing the Memorandum to
      your professors at the beginning of each semester.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Take Care of Yourself:</h4>
      <p>
      Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
      well, exercising, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax.
      This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
      </p>
      <p>
      All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
      alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an
      important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for
      help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
      life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
      encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services
      (CaPS-Q) is here to help: call 4454 8525 or make an appointment to see
      the counselor by emailing 
      <a href="mailto:student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu">student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu</a>. 
      Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust
      for help.
      </p>
      <p> 
      If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of
      self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night at 5554 7913.  If the
      situation is life threatening, call 999.</p>
