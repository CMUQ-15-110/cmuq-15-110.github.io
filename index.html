	<!-- <h1><b>15-110: Principles of Computing (Spring 2019)</b></h1>
      <br> -->
      <p>
        <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
      <p>
        As defined P. Denning et al. in an 1989 ACM report on
        <i>Computing as a Discipline</i>, <u>computing</u> is the
        "systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and
        transform information: their theory, analysis, design,
        efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental
        question underlying all computing is <i>what can be
        (efficiently) automated?</i>". This course precisely aims at
        introducing the science (and the art) of computing to students
        with little or no prior background in the matter.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        Given the inherent vastity of the topics involved in
        computing, the course will focus on a subset of the core
        aspects of computing, providing a brief, yet substantial
        introduction to many topics. The goal is to provide an idea of
        what's possible and how to realize it when it's useful (or,
        most often, necessary) to employ computation and computers to
        accomplish a complex goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course will balance the discussion of concepts central to
        design and understand computation with their practical
        implementation and testing using a specific <i>programming
        language</i>, <u>Python</u>. The choice of python is motivated
        by its widespread use, relative simplicity, availability of
        tools for scientific, graphical, and web programming, among
        others.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The course will take the student along the way that starts
        from a complex, possibly large problem to solve, and then move
        step by step to its <u>abstraction</u>, to its formalization into an
        <u>algorithmic recipe</u>, to the encoding of the algorithm using the
        <u>constructs of the python language</u>, to the run-time <u>execution</u>
        and <u>error correction</u> of the programming code, to the
        <u>efficiency analysis</u> of the developed algorithm and
        code. A number of <i>practical application scenarios</i> will be
        considered to ground the concepts to problems of interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a nutshell, the course will tackle the following topics:
        <ul>
          <li> Problem analysis: abstraction and representation </li>
          <li> Concepts central to design and understand algorithms</li>
          <li> Fundamental concepts of programming: </li>
          <ul>
            <li> Knowledge representation (data types and structures)</li>
            <li> Flow control (conditionals, iteration, recursion)</li>
            <li> Data organization (lists, matrices, dictionaries)</li>
            <li> Decomposition, reusability, information hiding (modules, functions, class objects)</li>
          </ul>
          <li> Python programming language to implement the above general concepts</li>
          <li> Computational problem-solving techniques (divide-and-conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)</li>
          <li> Correctness and efficiency of algorithms (testing, error finding, algorithmic complexity, optimization) </li>
          <li> Data visualization, animation, and statistical analysis </li>
          <li> Simulation models (deterministic and stochastic approaches) </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While the theoretical understanding of the concepts is always
        fundamental, the course emphasizes <u>hands-on</u>, meaning
        that learning will be mostly driven by the repeated
        implementation and application in python of the general
        concepts. <u>Weekly lab classes and programming homework</u> will
        support this way of proceeding. In the final three weeks, a
        <u>project</u> work will be devoloped by the students, that will
        allow to face the challenge of designing and implementing a
        relatively <i>large and complex code</i>.

        It will immediately run a series of tests on your code and give you a
        score with some feedback. Make sure to check it! If your code does not
        pass all tests, you can submit it again until the deadline. <span

      <h2><b>Tools</b></h2>
      <p>
      Set up your your programming environment by installing
      the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> distribution (Pyhton 3.7 version):
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos">For MacOS </a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows">For Windows </a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux">For Linux </a></li>
      </ul>
      
      The download is big, so make sure you are at a place with fast and 
      reliable internet connection.

      Once installed, you can start the <code>Anaconda-Navigator</code> and launch from there
      the <code>Spyder</code> editor, which you will use to develop and test your python code.

      We will run a program that detects code similarity on all your homework
      submissions. If students are found to have submitted almost the same
      code, they will be contacted and this may result on an academic integrity
      violation report.

      <h3>An Invitation to Students with Learning Disabilities:</h3>
      <p>
      Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable
      accommodations for all persons with disabilities. To access
      accommodation services you are expected to initiate the request and
      submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to the office of Health
      &amp; Wellness or CaPS-Q. In order to receive services/accommodations,
      verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a
      doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. The
      office of Health &amp; Wellness, CaPS-Q and Office of Disability Resources
      in Pittsburgh will review the information you provide. All information
      will be considered confidential and only released to appropriate persons
      on a need to know basis.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Once the accommodations have been approved, you will be issued a Summary
      of Accommodations Memorandum documenting the disability and describing
      the accommodation. You are responsible for providing the Memorandum to
      your professors at the beginning of each semester.
      </p><br>
      
      <h3>Take Care of Yourself:</h3>
      <p>
      Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
      well, exercising, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax.
      This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
      </p>
      <p>
      All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
      alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an
      important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for
      help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
      life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
      encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services
      (CaPS-Q) is here to help: call 4454 8525 or make an appointment to see
      the counselor by emailing 
      <a href="mailto:student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu">student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu</a>. 
      Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust
      for help.
      </p>
      <p> 
      If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of
      self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night at 5554 7913.  If the
      situation is life threatening, call 999.</p>
