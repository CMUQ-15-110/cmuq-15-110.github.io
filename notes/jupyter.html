Jupyter Notebook is an app that runs on the browser for editing and running
<i>notebook documents</i>. According to Jupyter's website:

<blockquote>
Notebook documents (or "notebooks", all lower case) are documents produced by
the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and
rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc.). Notebook
documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description
and the results (figures, tables, etc.) as well as executable documents which
can be run to perform data analysis,
</blockquote>

Even though it runs on the browser, it is not on the
internet! You will need to install it on your computer. Depending on how you
installed python, you may already have it. To check that, open the terminal (or
<i>cmd</i> for Windows) and type <tt>jupyter notebook</tt>.
If that does not work and you need to install it, go <a
href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter">here</a>.
If that does not work, come see the course staff.

<br>
<b>You will need to have Jupyter installed for the final course project.</b>
<br>
<br>

Once you have Jupyter, you will be able to open <a
href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb">this
notebook</a> containing some basic information about its elements.

<b>Some useful things to know:</b>

<ul>
<li> 
  Each box after a <tt>In []:</tt> tag is called a <i>cell</i>. 
</li>
<li> 
  Cells can contain python code <b>or</b> explanatory text. 
</li>
<li> 
  The explanatory text can be typed using <i>markdown text</i>. That's the same
  syntax used on wiki pages, for example. <a
  href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">This</a>
  is a nice cheatsheet with markdown commands to make your text look nice.
</li>
<li>
  There are two main keyboard shortcuts to run the code or display the text in a
  cell: <tt>ctrl + Enter</tt> and <tt>shift + enter</tt>. Using the
  <tt>shift</tt> one creates a new cell.
</li>
<li>
  Jupyter has two <i>modes</i>: a command mode (when cells cannot be edited and
  trying to type something down does weird things), and an edit mode (when cells
  can be edited). In command mode the left margin of the selected cell is blue,
  in edit mode it is green. You can switch modes by clicking in or out of a
  cell, or by typing <tt>esc</tt> and <tt>enter</tt>.
</li>
<li>
  Keyboard shortcuts are our friends. Once we get used to them, they save us a
  lot of time! To see what shortcuts are available in Jupyter, go to Help >
  Keyboard Shortcuts.
</li>
<li>
  To reset a notebook (delete variables, close files, etc.) and start it from
  scratch, go to Kernel > Restart.
</li>
<li>
  Googling things like "What is the markdown syntax for ...?" and "How do I
  ... in Jupyter?" is ok.
</li>
</ul>
